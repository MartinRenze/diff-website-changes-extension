# Diff Website Changes Extension for Chrome and Firefox

* Firefox is in a different branche, as manifest v3 from chrome and firefox are not compatible


* The extension only validates changes in the document body
* It detects differences, delete, add and change and highlights them. Either crossing out or underlining
